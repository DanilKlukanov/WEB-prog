                Then came the night of the first shooting star. She was spotted at dawn; she rushed over Winchester,
                to the east, very high, drawing a line of fire. Hundreds of people saw her and took her for an ordinary falling
                a star. According to the description of Albina, she left behind a greenish strip that burned for several seconds. Denning
                our greatest authority on meteorites, claimed that it became visible already at a distance of ninety or
                one hundred miles. It seemed to him that she had fallen to Earth about a hundred miles east of the place where he was.
                
                At this hour I was at home and wrote in my office; but although my window was facing Ottershaw and the curtain was raised
                (I loved to watch the night sky), I did not notice anything. However, this meteorite, the most extraordinary of all
                ever falling to Earth from world space, had to fall when I was sitting at the table and I could
                to see him if I looked at the sky. Some who have seen his flight say that he flew with a whistle,
                but I myself have not heard that. Many residents of Berkshire, Surrey and Middlesex saw his fall, and almost everyone thought
                that a new meteorite fell. That night, it seems, no one was interested in looking at the fallen mass.

                Poor Ogilvy, observing a meteorite and convinced that he fell somewhere in the wasteland between Horsell, Ottershaw
                and Woking, got up early in the morning and went to look for him. It was already dawn when he found a meteorite nearby
                from the sand pit. He saw a giant funnel dug by a fallen body, and piles of sand and gravel piled up
                among heather and noticeable for one and a half miles. Heather caught fire and smoldered, a transparent bare-goal smoke swirling against the morning sky.
                
                The fallen body buried itself in the sand, among the scattered slivers of pine that it had broken when it fell. The protruding part had the form
                huge burnt cylinder; its outlines were hidden by a thick scaly layer of dark soot. The cylinder was about thirty
                yards in diameter. Ogilvie approached this mass, struck by its volume and especially its shape, since meteorites are usually
                more or less spherical. However, the cylinder was so hot from flying through the atmosphere that it was still impossible for him
                get close enough. Ogilvy attributed the slight noise heard from within the cylinder to the uneven cooling of its surface.
                At this time, it did not occur to him that the cylinder could be hollow.
